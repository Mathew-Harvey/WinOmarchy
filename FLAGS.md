# FLAGS.md

Living register of judgement calls, deviations from the build brief, unverified
assumptions, and known limitations. Numbered, never deleted; closed entries keep
their number. A TODO or FIXME in code is only allowed if it cites a FLAG-n from
this file.

Status values: open (needs a decision), closed (decision made and recorded),
deferred-to-machine (cannot be verified in the Linux build container; needs a run
on Mat's Windows 11 machine).

## FLAG-1: built in a Linux container, machine gates deferred

Context: this build runs in a remote Ubuntu container with PowerShell 7.4.6
(pwsh), not on Mat's Windows 11 machine. All headless gates (check.ps1,
PSScriptAnalyzer, Pester, template rendering, config parsing) run here. Anything
that touches a real Windows session cannot run here: the manual swap checklist,
taskbar and desktop icon toggling, wallpaper application, winget installs, the
chooser render screenshot, real install and uninstall, the panic hotkey.

Decision: all code still targets Windows PowerShell 5.1 (enforced by the
compatibility grep in check.ps1 plus review discipline). Every on-machine gate is
listed in docs/manual-test-checklist.md and stays deferred-to-machine here rather
than being claimed as passed.

Status: deferred-to-machine.

## FLAG-2: repository name is WinOmarchy, product name is Winmarchy

Context: the brief describes a repo layout under a directory named winmarchy/.
The actual GitHub repository is Mathew-Harvey/WinOmarchy.

Decision: the Section 3 layout applies at the repository root unchanged. The
product, command, and install directory names stay winmarchy as specified.

Status: closed.

## FLAG-3: check.ps1 YAML parsing needs a parser dependency

Context: neither Windows PowerShell 5.1 nor PowerShell 7 ships a YAML parser.

Decision: check.ps1 uses the powershell-yaml module if present, otherwise falls
back to Python with PyYAML, otherwise fails with an instruction to install one.
The build container has powershell-yaml 0.4.12 installed.

Status: closed.

## FLAG-4: Pester 5 or newer required for the test suite

Context: Windows PowerShell 5.1 ships Pester 3.4.0, which cannot run this suite.
The build container has Pester 6.0.1.

Decision: tests are written for the Pester 5+ configuration API. check.ps1
detects Pester older than 5 and fails with the install instruction
(Install-Module Pester -Force -SkipPublisherCheck).

Status: closed.
