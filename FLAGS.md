# FLAGS.md

Living register of judgement calls, deviations from the build brief, unverified
assumptions, and known limitations. Numbered, never deleted; closed entries keep
their number. A TODO or FIXME in code is only allowed if it cites a FLAG-n from
this file.

Status values: open (needs a decision), closed (decision made and recorded),
deferred-to-machine (cannot be verified in the Linux build container; needs a run
on Mat's Windows 11 machine).

## FLAG-1: built in a Linux container, machine gates deferred

Context: this build runs in a remote Ubuntu container with PowerShell 7.4.6
(pwsh), not on Mat's Windows 11 machine. All headless gates (check.ps1,
PSScriptAnalyzer, Pester, template rendering, config parsing) run here. Anything
that touches a real Windows session cannot run here: the manual swap checklist,
taskbar and desktop icon toggling, wallpaper application, winget installs, the
chooser render screenshot, real install and uninstall, the panic hotkey.

Decision: all code still targets Windows PowerShell 5.1 (enforced by the
compatibility grep in check.ps1 plus review discipline). Every on-machine gate is
listed in docs/manual-test-checklist.md and stays deferred-to-machine here rather
than being claimed as passed.

Status: deferred-to-machine.

## FLAG-2: repository name is WinOmarchy, product name is Winmarchy

Context: the brief describes a repo layout under a directory named winmarchy/.
The actual GitHub repository is Mathew-Harvey/WinOmarchy.

Decision: the Section 3 layout applies at the repository root unchanged. The
product, command, and install directory names stay winmarchy as specified.

Status: closed.

## FLAG-3: check.ps1 YAML parsing needs a parser dependency

Context: neither Windows PowerShell 5.1 nor PowerShell 7 ships a YAML parser.

Decision: check.ps1 uses the powershell-yaml module if present, otherwise falls
back to Python with PyYAML, otherwise fails with an instruction to install one.
The build container has powershell-yaml 0.4.12 installed.

Status: closed.

## FLAG-4: Pester 5 or newer required for the test suite

Context: Windows PowerShell 5.1 ships Pester 3.4.0, which cannot run this suite.
The build container has Pester 6.0.1.

Decision: tests are written for the Pester 5+ configuration API. check.ps1
detects Pester older than 5 and fails with the install instruction
(Install-Module Pester -Force -SkipPublisherCheck).

Status: closed.

## FLAG-5: catppuccin nvim colorscheme deviates from Omarchy deliberately

Context: Omarchy ships the colorscheme name catppuccin-nvim for its catppuccin
theme. The brief directs Winmarchy to use the long-documented catppuccin-mocha
instead and to note the deviation. Theme JSON cannot carry comments, so the
note lives here.

Decision: themes/catppuccin.json sets nvim.colorscheme to catppuccin-mocha.

Status: closed.

## FLAG-6: wt -w new must be verified on the machine

Context: the keymap launches Neovim and the popup menu terminals with
"wt -w new" to force a new Windows Terminal window. It is the documented flag
for that purpose, but the brief (Section 6) requires verifying it on the
machine in Phase 2, and this container has no Windows Terminal.

Open question for Mat: run "wt -w new nvim" and
"wt -w new --title \"Winmarchy Menu\" powershell -NoProfile -Command exit"
once; confirm each opens a new window and the title sticks.

Status: deferred-to-machine.

## FLAG-7: yasb font family name needs an on-machine render check

Context: the brief (Section 4.3) says the GDI engine wants
'JetBrainsMono NFP' or 'JetBrainsMono Nerd Font' and to test which renders
icons correctly on the machine. styles.template.css lists both, NFP first.

Open question for Mat: after install, check the bar icons render as glyphs,
not boxes. If boxes, swap the order of the two families in
config/yasb/styles.template.css and run winmarchy theme set again.

Status: deferred-to-machine.

## FLAG-8: adversarial review findings applied after Phase 1

Context: a three-reviewer adversarial pass over the Phase 1 code confirmed
three real defects, all fixed with regression tests: (1) redirected native
stderr under ErrorActionPreference Stop crashes on Windows PowerShell 5.1
(check.ps1 now relaxes the preference around native calls); (2) the JSONC
comment and trailing-comma strippers were plain regexes that could corrupt
string values such as "cmd.exe /c echo {a,}" inside Windows Terminal
settings.json (now a string-aware character walk); (3) PowerShell pipeline
unrolling collapsed one-element and empty arrays in state round-trips (fixed
with comma-prefixed returns). Hardening from the same review: torn journal
lines are skipped with a warning, an unparseable state file falls back to
defaults, state writes go through a temp file and rename, null profiles or
defaults or schemes in settings.json are normalised, check.ps1 scans dotfiles
with -Force and survives unreadable files, and theme cycling compares names
case-insensitively.

Status: closed.
