# FLAGS.md

Living register of judgement calls, deviations from the build brief, unverified
assumptions, and known limitations. Numbered, never deleted; closed entries keep
their number. A TODO or FIXME in code is only allowed if it cites a FLAG-n from
this file.

Status values: open (needs a decision), closed (decision made and recorded),
deferred-to-machine (cannot be verified in the Linux build container; needs a run
on Mat's Windows 11 machine).

## FLAG-1: built in a Linux container, machine gates deferred

Context: this build runs in a remote Ubuntu container with PowerShell 7.4.6
(pwsh), not on Mat's Windows 11 machine. All headless gates (check.ps1,
PSScriptAnalyzer, Pester, template rendering, config parsing) run here. Anything
that touches a real Windows session cannot run here: the manual swap checklist,
taskbar and desktop icon toggling, wallpaper application, winget installs, the
chooser render screenshot, real install and uninstall, the panic hotkey.

Decision: all code still targets Windows PowerShell 5.1 (enforced by the
compatibility grep in check.ps1 plus review discipline). Every on-machine gate is
listed in docs/manual-test-checklist.md and stays deferred-to-machine here rather
than being claimed as passed.

Status: deferred-to-machine.

## FLAG-2: repository name is WinOmarchy, product name is Winmarchy

Context: the brief describes a repo layout under a directory named winmarchy/.
The actual GitHub repository is Mathew-Harvey/WinOmarchy.

Decision: the Section 3 layout applies at the repository root unchanged. The
product, command, and install directory names stay winmarchy as specified.

Status: closed.

## FLAG-3: check.ps1 YAML parsing needs a parser dependency

Context: neither Windows PowerShell 5.1 nor PowerShell 7 ships a YAML parser.

Decision: check.ps1 uses the powershell-yaml module if present, otherwise falls
back to Python with PyYAML, otherwise fails with an instruction to install one.
The build container has powershell-yaml 0.4.12 installed.

Status: closed.

## FLAG-4: Pester 5 or newer required for the test suite

Context: Windows PowerShell 5.1 ships Pester 3.4.0, which cannot run this suite.
The build container has Pester 6.0.1.

Decision: tests are written for the Pester 5+ configuration API. check.ps1
detects Pester older than 5 and fails with the install instruction
(Install-Module Pester -Force -SkipPublisherCheck).

Status: closed.

## FLAG-5: catppuccin nvim colorscheme deviates from Omarchy deliberately

Context: Omarchy ships the colorscheme name catppuccin-nvim for its catppuccin
theme. The brief directs Winmarchy to use the long-documented catppuccin-mocha
instead and to note the deviation. Theme JSON cannot carry comments, so the
note lives here.

Decision: themes/catppuccin.json sets nvim.colorscheme to catppuccin-mocha.

Status: closed.

## FLAG-6: wt -w new must be verified on the machine

Context: the keymap launches Neovim and the popup menu terminals with
"wt -w new" to force a new Windows Terminal window. It is the documented flag
for that purpose, but the brief (Section 6) requires verifying it on the
machine in Phase 2, and this container has no Windows Terminal.

Open question for Mat: run "wt -w new nvim" and
"wt -w new --title \"Winmarchy Menu\" powershell -NoProfile -Command exit"
once; confirm each opens a new window and the title sticks.

Status: deferred-to-machine.

## FLAG-7: yasb font family name needs an on-machine render check

Context: the brief (Section 4.3) says the GDI engine wants
'JetBrainsMono NFP' or 'JetBrainsMono Nerd Font' and to test which renders
icons correctly on the machine. styles.template.css lists both, NFP first.

Open question for Mat: after install, check the bar icons render as glyphs,
not boxes. If boxes, swap the order of the two families in
config/yasb/styles.template.css and run winmarchy theme set again.

Status: deferred-to-machine.

## FLAG-8: adversarial review findings applied after Phase 1

Context: a three-reviewer adversarial pass over the Phase 1 code confirmed
three real defects, all fixed with regression tests: (1) redirected native
stderr under ErrorActionPreference Stop crashes on Windows PowerShell 5.1
(check.ps1 now relaxes the preference around native calls); (2) the JSONC
comment and trailing-comma strippers were plain regexes that could corrupt
string values such as "cmd.exe /c echo {a,}" inside Windows Terminal
settings.json (now a string-aware character walk); (3) PowerShell pipeline
unrolling collapsed one-element and empty arrays in state round-trips (fixed
with comma-prefixed returns). Hardening from the same review: torn journal
lines are skipped with a warning, an unparseable state file falls back to
defaults, state writes go through a temp file and rename, null profiles or
defaults or schemes in settings.json are normalised, check.ps1 scans dotfiles
with -Force and survives unreadable files, and theme cycling compares names
case-insensitively.

Status: closed.

## FLAG-9: taskbar and desktop icon techniques need machine verification

Context: the brief (Section 3) prescribes SHAppBarMessage ABM_SETSTATE for
taskbar auto-hide and WM_COMMAND 0x7402 to SHELLDLL_DefView for the live icon
toggle, with registry fallbacks, and says to verify both on the machine in
Phase 3 before relying on them. The container cannot exercise either. Both
are implemented with the registry state read first (0x7402 is a blind
toggle) and the icon path falls back to HideIcons plus an Explorer restart
when SHELLDLL_DefView cannot be found.

Open question for Mat: checklist items A1 and A2 in
docs/manual-test-checklist.md cover this; if either technique no-ops on the
current Windows 11 build, say so and the fallback becomes the primary.

Status: deferred-to-machine.

## FLAG-10: config/ is deployed alongside bin/, themes/ and templates/

Context: the brief Section 7.5 step 4 lists bin/, themes/ and templates/ as
the payload copied to %LOCALAPPDATA%\winmarchy. The theme engine re-renders
the yasb stylesheet at runtime from config/yasb/styles.template.css, so that
file must exist in the deployed tree too.

Decision: install.ps1 also copies config/ to %LOCALAPPDATA%\winmarchy\config,
keeping one path shape (root/config/yasb/styles.template.css) valid in both
the repo and the deployed layout.

Status: closed.

## FLAG-11: chooser render test and crash-fallback drill need the machine

Context: dotnet build of the chooser is clean (0 warnings, 0 errors, built
from the container with EnableWindowsTargeting), but the Phase 5 gate also
wants the --render-test screenshot reviewed, the mid-swap kill fallback
demonstrated, and the countdown and keyboard paths exercised. Those need
Windows with the WebView2 runtime. A stand-in preview of the page rendered
in headless Chromium was produced and shared for the visual eyeball.

Open question for Mat: after install, run
"%LOCALAPPDATA%\winmarchy\chooser\Winmarchy.Chooser.exe --render-test" and
review artifacts\chooser.png, then run checklist section D.

Status: deferred-to-machine.

## FLAG-12: the Phase 7 end-to-end run is Mat's sign-off

Context: the definition of done is the Section 1 vision statement being
demonstrably true on the machine: chooser at login, both halves beautiful,
clean swaps both ways surviving reboots and a mid-swap kill, panic hotkey,
uninstall to baseline. None of that can run in the build container.

Open question for Mat: run docs/manual-test-checklist.md end to end
(sections A through D plus three B cycles), record the run in its log
table, and file anything that misbehaves as a new FLAG entry.

The full deferred-to-machine set at handover: FLAG-1 (environment), FLAG-6
(wt -w new), FLAG-7 (bar font rendering), FLAG-9 (taskbar and icon
techniques), FLAG-11 (chooser render test and fallback drill), and this
entry.

Status: deferred-to-machine.

## FLAG-13: final adversarial review findings applied at wrap-up

Context: a four-reviewer pass (5.1 compatibility, safety audit, brief
conformance, chooser C#) with two adversarial skeptics per finding confirmed
four real defects, all fixed with tests: (1) the captured win11 baseline
(wallpaper, light/dark) was never cleared after restore, so changes the user
made later in Windows 11 mode were silently reverted on every subsequent
swap-back; enter-win11 now clears the saved values so the next Omarchy entry
recaptures the current baseline. (2) Uninstall restored the install-day
Windows Terminal settings wholesale, destroying customisations made since;
it now surgically removes only the Winmarchy schemes and the
defaults.colorScheme reference, and leaves settings.json.winmarchy-bak in
place as a by-hand recovery option. This deliberately deviates from the
brief's "restore from the bak" wording in favour of its intent (baseline
restoration without collateral loss). (3) The numbered menu fallback wrote
its display lines into the function's return stream; they now go to the
console directly. (4) The chooser never subscribed to WebView2 ProcessFailed
and relied on implicit focus; it now falls back on a process failure and
focuses the WebView after navigation. A separate mid-build fix: the first
enter-omarchy now applies wallpaper and app mode via an explicit -AsOmarchy
switch (state.mode still reads win11 until commit) with both mutations
journalled.

Status: closed.

## FLAG-14: setup wizard is WPF hosted in PowerShell, untestable headlessly

Context: the guided installer needs to run on a machine where nothing is
installed yet, so it cannot depend on the .NET SDK (which would be a
chicken-and-egg problem, since the SDK is only needed to build the chooser
and may be absent). It is therefore a WPF window hosted directly in Windows
PowerShell 5.1 via XamlReader: no build step, no dependency, runs from a
fresh clone. The XAML carries no x:Class and no event attributes because
XamlReader cannot bind them; every handler is wired in PowerShell, and a
test asserts the file stays that way.

Decision: all decision logic lives in installer/wizard-lib.ps1 with no UI,
so preflight rules, option interlocks, the answers-to-parameters mapping and
the review text are all covered by tests (including one asserting the wizard
only ever names parameters install.ps1 actually has). The wizard never
reimplements the install: every choice becomes a switch passed to
install.ps1, and the review page's step list is real install.ps1 -WhatIf
output. A text-mode wizard (install-ui.ps1 -Console) asks the same questions
and is the automatic fallback when WPF cannot start; that path was smoke-run
end to end in the container.

Open question for Mat: the WPF window itself cannot run here, so the visual
result, the STA launch through install-ui.cmd, the runspace log streaming
and the theme preview all need a run on the machine. A rendered mock of the
four main pages was produced and shared for the design eyeball. Checklist
section E covers the run.

Status: deferred-to-machine.
